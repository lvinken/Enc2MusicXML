Enc2MusicXML is a Qt tool that converts Encore files to MusicXML.
It was developed using Qt 5.8.0 and Apple LLVM version 7.3.0
(clang-703.0.31) on OS X 10.11.6.

## Status

Proof of concept. It extracts the same information from Encore files as does enc2ly,
but the MusicXML export is very rudimentary.

## Building

* Install the [Qt](https://www.qt.io) toolkit.
* Open Enc2MusicXML.pro in Qt Creator and build the project.

Alternatively, build on the command line using:

 qmake
 make

## Running

Enc2MusicXML writes output to stdout and (lots of) debug info
to stderr. To convert an Encore file to MusicXML on Unix, use:

 Enc2MusicXML -m file.enc >file.musicxml 2>/dev/null

## Testing

Test data and an autotester (iotest) are provided in the testdata directory.
